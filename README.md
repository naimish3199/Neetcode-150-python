# Neetcode-150 â€“ Python Solutions ðŸ§ 

This repository contains my Python solutions to the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/) curated list of coding interview problems.  
As a data scientist, Iâ€™m strengthening my problem-solving skills through focused DSA practice.

Each solution is written in clean, readable Python and includes:
- A link to the original problem
- A brief explanation or approach
- Time and space complexity

This project helps me stay consistent and accountable â€” and also serves as a resource for others preparing for interviews.

> ðŸ“Œ Goal: Solve all 150 problems in Python and document the process.
